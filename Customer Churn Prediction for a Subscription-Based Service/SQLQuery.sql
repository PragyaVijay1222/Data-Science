-- So the first step in churn analysis is to load the data from our source file. For this purpose we will be using Microsoft SQL server because it is a widely used solution across the industry and also because a full-fledged Database System is better at handling recurring data loads and maintaining data integrity compared to an excel file.

-- Creating Database

CREATE DATABASE db_Churn

--Import csv into SQL server staging table – Import Wizard
--Task >> Import >> Flat file >> Browse CSV file
--Change Bit to Varchar(50)
